          <p><h2>Exodus Wallet Review – login</h2>
<br>A Beginner’s Guide By: Ofir Beigel | Last updated: 5/31/22 Exodus is a multi-currency wallet that I usually recommend as an entry wallet for beginners. In this post I’ll review the different wallet features and why I think it’s one of the best wallets around.


<br>Exodus Review Summary Exodus is an easy to use multi-currency software wallet that is available for desktop and mobile. The wallet excels in its simple design and superb online support. The main downside of Exodus is its lack of custom network fees for Ethereum and other altcoins and the fact that it is not completely open-source.

 


<br>1. Exodus Overview Exodus Movement INC. was founded in 2015 by JP Richardson and Daniel Castagnoli and is headquartered in Nebraska. The company hasn’t reported any outside funding throughout the years and is currently actively seeking to expand.

 


<br>2. <a href="https://cobenstusliner.com/rMRR85FXsjbmwT3Qt6MCtg4m">Exodus wallet </a>review My acquaintance with Exodus started out by accident, when one of our subscribers told me he didn’t like my choice for the best Bitcoin wallet I recommended at that time, and that he used Exodus instead.

 


<br>That subscriber got my attention, so I decided to take a look into Exodus as well.


<br>Exodus is a multicurrency wallet for desktop, and as of recently, for mobile as well (iOS and Android). The wallet creators put an emphasis on design and user interface, making it in my opinion, the most appealing and easy-to-use wallet around. Even if you’re just starting out with Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies you would still be able to use this wallet effortlessly. Exodus is the kind of product you “fall in love with” the first time you use it, and that’s quite rare in the cryptocurrency world.


<br>Exodus navigation is pretty simple and easy to understand, the mobile app has only 3 categories: Portfolio – See an overview of all of the cryptoassets you’re holding (as seen in the picture above). Also shows price graphs for different assets. Wallet – Send or receive specific coins.

 

<p><h3>Exchange</h3>


<br>Exodus has a built in exchange that allows you to trade between cryptocurrencies without ever leaving the wallet. The desktop app includes all of the above, plus these additional tabs: Backup – Allows you to restore your wallet password or your wallet’s seed phrase. Settings – Security and design tweaks to your Exodus wallet. Help – Watch videos, FAQ, join a Slack chat or email support. App Explorer – The app explorer has a featured app section that makes it easy to find and use crypto apps within the Exodus wallet. These apps can be used for earning interest on your coins, betting and more.

 


<br>When you use Exodus, the private keys to your cryptocurrencies are stored on your device (desktop or mobile). Additionally, Exodus is a lite wallet so you won’t need to download the whole Blockchain to your device, making the initial setup pretty quick.

 


<br><a href="https://cobenstusliner.com/rMRR85FXsjbmwT3Qt6MCtg4m"> Exodus.login </a> is currently compatible with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android. You can also pair your desktop and mobile wallets together so you’ll have control over your funds from both devices. The wallet is also compatible with TREZOR hardware wallets, allowing you to use the sleek Exodus interface with the robust security of a hardware wallet.

<br><b>Security</b>

<br>A key factor to be noted specific to security is that as of this writing, Exodus does not have access to your assets or private keys. The wallet’s non-custodial framework means that all storage and encryption takes place on the user’s hard drive, not on the Exodus platform. Once the platform has been downloaded, users access their account via password. Should users need to recover their account, they will be prompted to do so via a 12-word recovery phrase.

<br>For users who prefer securing their assets offline, Exodus has partnered with Trezor to allow users to manage their assets from the Trezor hardware wallet. With the hardware wallet connected to Exodus, users can send, exchange, and receive assets while maintaining their private keys and assets offline. One item to note is that Trezor supports hundreds of assets.

<P><h3>Conclusion</h3>

I review a lot of Bitcoin wallets and rarely do I stumble upon a wallet that is truly outstanding as Exodus. For my personal needs, this wallet is almost perfect – “almost” and not “perfect” due to the lack of fee management for altcoins. The new addition of custom fees management for Bitcoin is a step in the right direction. There’s no doubt that if you’re new to Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general, Exodus will allow you an easy entrance. Have you had any experience with Exodus? I’d love to hear about it in the comment section below.
